## 💡 what is propane?

**propane** is a performance booster mod for Minecraft (client-side only).  
it brings modern optimization techniques that make the game run **faster and lighter**, even on toasters.

whether you're exploring huge modpacks or just wanna boost vanilla, propane’s here to help.

## 🚀 features

### ✅ async chunk loading  
renders chunks **off the main thread**, so the game doesn't freeze or stutter when new areas load.

### ✅ multi-core pathfinding  
entity AI is calculated using **multiple CPU cores**, reducing lag from mob movement and navigation.

### ✅ entity culling  
entities **too far away or not visible** are ignored for rendering and updates — saving CPU/GPU.

### ✅ lazy tileentity tick  
tile entities like chests and furnaces will **only tick when needed**, saving processing time.

### ✅ ultra fps mode  
a one-click command (`/propane ultrafps`) that tweaks your settings for **maximum FPS**.

### ✅ memory & texture optimizations  
cleans up unused textures and memory pools to keep Minecraft feeling **snappy**.

### ✅ real-time adjustments  
the mod monitors your FPS and can **adapt settings** on the fly to avoid lag spikes or stutters.

## 🧠 commands

you can control propane with simple commands like:

- `/propane toggle` – enable or disable the mod  
- `/propane ultrafps` – go max FPS mode instantly
- `/propane lock` – lock your graphics settings so they don’t auto-change  
- `/propane debug` – show memory usage, FPS, and engine stats  
- `/propane help` – full list of commands

but those are not all commands.

## ❓why the name "propane"?

because it’s a fuel — and this mod fuels your FPS! (and because naming optimization mods chemicals are very popular)

- client-side only (safe for servers)  
- works with most versions of Minecraft Forge  
- should be compatible with most mods (doesn't touch worldgen or game rules)
